# Appendix A: Worked Example – Calculating Reality Using the Fadi Tempo Unit (FTU) and the Frequency Meta-Axiom

---

## Scenario: A Single Quantum Event in the Matrix of Existence

Let’s consider the birth of a photon—a packet of light energy—in a controlled quantum system (e.g., a laboratory laser).

---

### Step 1: Identify the Minimal Change

In Master Mind Genesis, all existence is quantized into **Fadi Tempo Units (FTU)**.  
Suppose the emission of a single photon represents **one FTU**:  
> The smallest measurable “tick” of existence in this system is the FTU.

---

### Step 2: Context and Frequency

- **Frequency (f):** The photon’s frequency (e.g., visible red light at 4.3 × 10¹⁴ Hz).  
- **Context (QC):** “Photon emission in laboratory vacuum, at room temperature.”

---

### Step 3: Apply the Root Equation

**Root Equation:**  
R = fₜ × QC

(Reality = Fadi Tempo Unit × Quantum Context)

For our photon:  
- **fₜ (FTU):** 1 (single quantum event)  
- **QC (Quantum Context):** 1 (normalized value for this example)

R = 1 × 1 = 1 FTU


> The reality of this photon event, in this context, is **1 FTU**—the atomic “pixel” of reality, indivisible and foundational.

---

### Step 4: Sum Over All Events (Frequency Meta-Axiom)

Per the **Frequency Meta-Axiom**:  

Meta-Existence = Frequency Network × FTU Matrix


- **Frequency Network:** Distribution of all photon frequencies (here, identical).  
- **FTU Matrix:** A lattice where each node represents one FTU event.

If the laser emits 10⁹ photons per second:  
- **10⁹ FTUs** populate the Matrix of Existence in one second.  
- The fabric of reality for that second is a structured lattice of 10⁹ FTUs.

---

### Step 5: Challenge / Interpretation

- **Challenge:** If any scientist can define, subdivide, or measure a “reality unit” smaller than the FTU in this context, the axiom is broken.  
- **Interpretation:** If no smaller unit exists, the Master Mind Genesis law stands—every event, in every context, is measured in FTUs, structured by frequency and context, building the Matrix of Existence.

## Summary Table

| Event              | Frequency       | Context        | FTU    | Reality (R) |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Single Photon      | 4.3 × 10¹⁴ Hz   | Lab (vacuum)   | 1      | 1           |
| 1 s Laser Output   | 4.3 × 10¹⁴ Hz   | Lab (vacuum)   | 10⁹    | 10⁹         |

## Closing Note

This worked example demonstrates how any phenomenon—quantum or classical—can be mapped, measured, and challenged using the Master Mind Genesis framework. It is the scientist’s job to break this minimum; if they cannot, a new law of existence has just been born.
